# finalproject_linuswidmer

## Aim:

The current research project investigates the development of conscientiousness over the lifespan based on a lingitudinal analysis of the German Socio Economic Panel study.

## File structure

The file conscientiousness_lifespan.pdf contains a theoretical inctroduction to the topic and guides the reader through the attempt of the statistical modeling.  
The code which was used to analyize the panel data can be found in soep.Rmd. Because of the large size of the dataset it was not possible to knit the Rmd file.  
I am not able to provide the data itself because it may not shared publicly. However if the reader has access to the panel data loading the "SOEP-CORE.v37eu_R_EN/R_EN/pl.rds" and "SOEP-CORE.v37eu_R_EN/R_EN/biobirth.rds" of the soep core dataset should run the code seemlessly.  
The file Attempts.Rmd contains a couple of failed code attempts which I may wanted to look at later
